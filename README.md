# odin-library

In this project I created a personal library app where a user can add books using a form, remove books from the shelf, and edit read/not-read status

Through this project I learned and implemented following concepts:
- JavaScript Objects
- Object Constructors
- Instantiating object using "new" keyword

- CSS Grid Layout
- HTML in built form validation
